## Idea


The Powerlifting Gym Database is designed to manage coaches, members, equipment, equipment usage and competitions within the gym. It is important that we prioritise every essential part of managing and running a powerlifting gym into one organised and efficient process.
Unlike standard commercial gyms, powerlifting gyms has unique running behaviour such as:
Individual Coaching Services (i.e. Strength Coaching, Nutrition Coaching, Rehab Coaching.
Competition Preparation
High standard of Equipment Maintenance
Membership Arrangements
Our idea is to create a conservative database that acts as the foundation of the gym to link members, equipment, coaching, etc. So it is easier to manage and make easier integration and changes for the gym in the future.


## Why It's Necessary

Gyms require a structured system to professionally manage their data, bringing every essential aspect of gym operations into one organized and manageable system. 
The system will improve member management by tracking attendance, payment status, training programmes and personal details efficiently. 
It will also streamline coach management, allowing coaches to handle their clients and fees seamlessly. 
Safety will be improved through effective equipment management, ensuring proper storage and maintenance, which reduces downtime and unexpected expenses. 
The system will support better preparation for upcoming events and competitions, removing the need for last minute rush, ensuring smooth running. 
Pricing and membership plans will be consistent yet transparent, with payment structures stored securely to ensure accurate billing. 
Additionally, the collected data will empower decision making across the business, helping with equipment purchases, tailoring client training, and identifying the most successful competitions.
